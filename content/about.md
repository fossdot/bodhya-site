Bodhya emerged from a simple observation: Bihar has talented students, but they lack access to tech opportunities and networks that students in metros take for granted.

For years, open source communities across India have shown that talent thrives when barriers disappear—no gatekeeping, no geography, just contribution and collaboration. 

Bodhya was created as a collective response to that gap. It brings together FOSS communities, industry professionals, and local educators to help students in Bihar build visibility, work on real-world open source projects, and access internships and jobs without having to leave home.  

Starting January 2026, Bodhya is being built full‑time as a community initiative—supported by [FOSS United’s](https://fossunited.org) ecosystem, volunteer mentors from across India, and students who are already proving that world‑class tech talent exists in Bihar when given the right opportunities.

We will soon list the names of active volunteers here.

## The Name

*Bodhya* means "worthy of knowledge" or "capable of being awakened" in Sanskrit. It reflects our belief that every student has potential—they just need the right spark and opportunity.
