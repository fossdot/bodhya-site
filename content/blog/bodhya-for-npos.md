Over the past few years of building tech communities and working with nonprofits, I've noticed something consistent: almost every non-profit organisations (NPO/NGO) I meet is drowning in spreadsheets. Their data lives in different places. Donor reports are pulled together manually. Field teams waste time entering data. And when their tech vendor disappears, the whole system becomes a paperweight.

This is a real problem, and it's exactly where Bodhya Consulting can help. 

## The NPO Tech Problem

Most nonprofits don't need fancy software. They need something straightforward. A place where program data lives. Where they can track beneficiaries. Where they can pull together donor reports without copying numbers between five different sheets. They need a system their team can own, understand, and actually use.

But here's what happens instead. Some nonprofits patch together different tools: a spreadsheet here, a form there, maybe some CRM. It's fragmented. Data gets duplicated. Mistakes happen. And when the contract ends, nobody on the team knows how to maintain it.  

The other problem is that big software companies don't care much about the nonprofit sector. They see limited budgets and complex requirements that don't fit standard templates. So nonprofits get ignored or sold solutions that are way too complicated for what they actually need.  

## What Bodhya Can Do

This is why I think Bodhya Consulting is positioned to fill this gap. 

We understand how to build software that's simple, maintainable, and actually belongs to the organization that uses it. We work with open-source stacks. We keep things modular so you're not locked in. And we actually stick around to help you own what we build.  

For non-profits, this could mean many things depending on what's breaking:  

**Management Information Systems**: Design a system around your actual workflows. Not a generic template, but something built for how your teams actually work. Program data, beneficiary tracking, activity logs, outcomes. All in one place, accessible to the people who need it.  

**Organizational Processes and Workflows**: Your nonprofit probably has complex internal processes. How do approvals work? How do projects move from proposal to execution? How does communication flow between departments? We can map these out and build systems that make them work smoothly instead of falling apart in email threads and spreadsheets.  

**HR and Payroll Systems**: Managing staff across multiple locations is messy. Leave approvals, performance tracking, payroll, compliance documents. If your HR is scattered across different tools, we can consolidate it into something that your HR team can actually use without pulling their hair out.  

**Donor Reporting and Finance**: Different donors want different data in different formats on different timelines. We can set up dashboards and automated reports so your finance and M&E team isn't spending half their time copying data. They can focus on analyzing impact instead. 

**Field Operations and Data Collection**: Data collection needs to work where your teams are. Mobile forms. Offline capability if you need it. Simple interfaces. No fancy UX that confuses field staff. Tools that actually work in low bandwidth settings.  

**Integrations Across Systems**: You probably already use email, spreadsheets, accounting software, maybe a CRM. We help these talk to each other so you're not entering the same data twice. One integrated workflow instead of jumping between systems.  

**Your Team Owns It**: At the end of our work, your staff understands what we built. You have documentation that makes sense. You can modify it. You can grow it. You're not dependent on a vendor to change a single thing. 

## How We'd Work Together

The process is straightforward. We start with discovery: conversations with your leadership, program teams, finance, HR, and whoever else is affected. We map out where problems are, what tools you're using, what causes friction. We get specific about constraints and needs.  

Then we design something minimal. Not everything at once. We start with the most painful piece. The thing that will make the biggest difference if it works. Maybe it's your donor reporting nightmare. Maybe it's HR processes that haven't been updated in years. Maybe it's getting field teams to actually use the tools you give them. Whatever keeps your team up at night.  

We build in small cycles. Test it. Get feedback. Improve. This isn't a big reveal at the end. This is iterative work where you see progress and can steer as we go.  

And we don't disappear after launch. We offer retainers for ongoing support, maintenance, and training. Your team grows into the system. New requirements come up. Your organizational tech evolves with your work.  

## Why This Matters

When your nonprofit has systems that actually work, a few things happen. Donors see better reporting and trust you more. Grants become easier to secure. Your team spends less time fighting with tech and more time doing the actual work. Staff turnover goes down because they're not exhausted by manual processes. You make decisions faster because the information is there, clean and accessible. 

Nonprofits are solving some of the hardest problems in society. They shouldn't be wasting energy on broken tech stacks. 

## Who We've Worked With

Over time, I’ve been lucky to work with organisations that are deeply invested in education, research, and worker rights. A few of them include:

- **[Takshashila Institution](https://takshashila.org.in/)**: A public policy think tank working on better governance and institutions in India, where technology supports research, outreach, and internal operations.  
- **[Bhasha Research](https://bhasharesearch.org/)**: An organisation focused on language, culture, and community research that needs reliable systems to manage programs, documentation, and collaborations.  
- **[PeriFerry](https://www.periferry.com/)**: A social enterprise building inclusive workplaces for transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, where tech helps them track programs, partners, and impact.  
- **[India Labourline](https://indialabourline.org/)**: A national helpline and mediation program that improves access to justice for informal workers through field centers, fellows, and a toll-free line.  

Each of these collaborations has reinforced a simple idea: the right systems can quietly unlock a lot of capacity for mission-driven teams, without getting in their way.
