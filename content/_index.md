# Creating Tech Opportunities for Bihar Students

Bihar has immense potential. But students here often miss opportunities simply because they're not connected to the right networks, mentors, and industry partners.

**Bodhya changes that.**

We're building a bridge between Bihar's students, colleges, and the tech industry. Through training, FOSS adoption, mentorship, internships, and skill-building, we're proving that world-class tech talent doesn't need to leave home to thrive.

## What We Do

- **Connect** students with industry mentors and volunteer experts
- **Enable** internships and job opportunities locally
- **Support** skill development through workshops and peer learning

## Why Now?

The tech ecosystem in India is growing rapidly. But most opportunities flow toward metros and IITs. Students from tier-2 and tier-3 colleges, especially in Bihar, rarely get a fair shot.

We're changing that story. Starting January 2026.
